# Introduction

The UK faces the simultaneous challenges of Brexit and Covid-19. Either would stretch any nation’s economy to the limit and Covid has arguably hit the UK’s economy harder than its EU neighbours’. The uncertainties surrounding these twin challenges and basic nature of any initial deal with the UK’s most important trade partner, will weigh on the country’s economy in the months and years ahead. 

# Objectives
1. This call is devoted to the advancement of the understanding of the entire spectrum of policy and control issues and their interactions to economic phenomena following exit from the Covid-19 crisis and from the European Union. The uncertainty over the nature of final agreements on trade will tend to lead to firms delaying investment and it’s very hard for regions to regain their internationally competitive advantage, once lost, as a result of the scarring from these events.   
2. This conference will bring together researchers from different research communities for an interdisciplinary stocktaking of the state of the art of research on the consequences of Brexit - and on the implications of the British withdrawal from the EU and devastating consequences on European integration. 
3. The organisers invite submissions from scholars working on policy and practical issues and from those having a more theoretical or normative angle. Two special issues of high quality journals will serve as a legacy to record the unprecedented events that we are facing in the field of Finance; the *European Journal of Finance* and *Economic Modelling* have contributed special issues and welcome your submissions.
